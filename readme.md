## BankOfSpring
Production ready maven based Spring Boot starter kit application with example cases of handling transactions with Spring.

## Description
Starter kit for booting up the development of a API oriented and transaction based spring Java server. It contains the best practices and latest tools that a spring boot developer should opt for in a fresh development. Since JPA is used, developers are free to opt for any SQL based DB engine for persistence (H2 has been used as an example with this project). The preferred IDE for development is IntelliJ which comes with a plethora of useful JAVA tools to support Spring Boot development, but developers are free to opt for Eclipse or STS as well. The focus in this project is solely upon the SpringBoot development with business cases involving transactions and writting proper unit and integration tests for them.
